    <description>
		A strongly typed package to wrap the Intrinio FinTech data api (www.intrinio.com). 
		Author not affiliated with intrinio in any way, not does this come with any warranty. Contributions welcome.

    <releaseNotes>
		Sorry in advance!
		Massive refactor and breaking changes as result of reworking and renaming to split out concepts of "GetSingleResult", "GetListOfResults"
		and "GetListOfResultsWithPagingMetaData", which became blindingly obvious as I started to pipe more specific requests through to Intrinio.
		Mildly enhanced test cases to capture some of these scenarios.
		Some errors in Intrinio doco meant code definitions were off, have been brought into line now but their staff may
		make additional changes to their API - so still in flux.
		Unfortunately, these changes meant a BIG change to the way I named things, which I had intended to leave stable.
